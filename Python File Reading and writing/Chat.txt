16/02/2021, 21:33 - Num: Only one question?
16/02/2021, 21:33 - Num: I am not sure tbh why is it!
16/02/2021, 21:33 - Num: 7
16/02/2021, 21:33 - Num: Could it be the equation? And the steps? But I mean no time
16/02/2021, 21:33 - Num: Wait let me solve it again and check
16/02/2021, 21:44 - AlyaFeai: Is my solution wrong
16/02/2021, 21:44 - AlyaFeai: He gave me 0
16/02/2021, 21:44 - AlyaFeai: For this question
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: P=0
P1=-3
P2=24
P3=1725
It divergent
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: Sorry i just noticed the fixed point part
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: So it need the integration of the equation to be used
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: But either ways it is still correct that its divergent so it's a little harsh to get 0
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: Try to talk to him about it
17/02/2021, 10:54 - Num: I hope you get these messages before you sleep today.. But if it doesn't get you I am sorry

17/02/2021, 11:55 - Num: (-5)/(x^2-3)
17/02/2021, 11:56 - Num: Not sure if it makes sence
17/02/2021, 11:56 - Num: Sense *
17/02/2021, 11:56 - Num: Or if it's correct either
17/02/2021, 11:57 - AlyaFeai: why did u divide 5 by everything
17/02/2021, 12:01 - Num: Because
X^3-3x =-5
So we can use x now 
x(x^3-3) =-5
Then we just get x out
X = -5/x^2-3
17/02/2021, 12:03 - AlyaFeai: :ASOEJGOKGAPG[a'

24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: I will go to sleep
24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: ```
eqx='(22-(2*y)+z)/4'
eqy='(1+x+(3*z))/6'
eqz='(16-(2*x)+(5*y))/8'
temp=[1,1,1]
x,y,z=temp
for a in range(4+1):
    temp[0]=eval(eqx)
    temp[1]=eval(eqy)
    temp[2]=eval(eqz)
    print(f'{a}\t{round(x,6)}\t{round(y,6)}\t{round(z,6)}')
    x,y,z=temp
```
24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: if you want it this is the code
24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: the equation for x y z the first three lines
24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: temp is the initial points
24/02/2021, 00:29 - AlyaFeai: and range(4+1)
means 4 iterations after P0
24/02/2021, 00:30 - AlyaFeai: wish u the best and if I am awake u can send me questions

04/03/2021, 13:11 - AlyaFeai: fixed point
04/03/2021, 13:12 - Num: إي واحد؟
04/03/2021, 13:12 - AlyaFeai: الي المسألة
04/03/2021, 13:12 - AlyaFeai: 3x-cos(x)
04/03/2021, 13:12 - AlyaFeai: وتحليها بالفكس بوينت
04/03/2021, 13:12 - AlyaFeai: والبداية 0
04/03/2021, 13:12 - Num: اوه يس
04/03/2021, 13:12 - Num: مالو؟
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: you remember we study it
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: as you should
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: x for both side
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: to make it
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: G(x) = x
04/03/2021, 13:13 - Num: <Media omitted>
04/03/2021, 13:13 - Num: Yeah?
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: if you do that
04/03/2021, 13:13 - AlyaFeai: you will have equation

04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: 4x-cos(x)
04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: and if you start using fixed point method
04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: u will get
04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: -6
04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: apparently the way to solve was to take -cos(x) to the other side and then
3x=cos(x)
x = cos(x)/3
04/03/2021, 13:14 - AlyaFeai: and you use this equation to substiute
04/03/2021, 13:15 - AlyaFeai: I took me like 20 mins

07/03/2021, 00:02 - Num: Of you are laying down or standing.
07/03/2021, 00:03 - Num: And how do your brain know that?
07/03/2021, 00:03 - Num: From the inner ear
07/03/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: It knows that
07/03/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: By
07/03/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: Calculating
07/03/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: The
07/03/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: Bending of each muscle

07/03/2021, 00:03 - Num: No not necessarily
07/03/2021, 00:04 - Num: If you are standing or laying. You are in the same position but the difference is that you are just vertical instead

07/03/2021, 00:56 - Num: No prob
07/03/2021, 00:56 - Num: O. Kay
07/03/2021, 00:56 - Num: Can you explain more?
07/03/2021, 00:56 - AlyaFeai: like for example
07/03/2021, 00:56 - AlyaFeai: when you get for it
07/03/2021, 00:57 - AlyaFeai: cup of tea
07/03/2021, 00:57 - AlyaFeai: it will start

07/03/2021, 00:57 - AlyaFeai: it has small parts
07/03/2021, 00:57 - AlyaFeai: which they are

07/03/2021, 00:59 - Num: And what about the functionalism school?
07/03/2021, 00:59 - AlyaFeai: this one I wasn't bother to understand it
07/03/2021, 00:59 - AlyaFeai: becasue it's ununderstandble
07/03/2021, 00:59 - AlyaFeai: not understandble
07/03/2021, 01:01 - Num: You can thin of it as a function.
How the behaviors or human work to help them live in the environment.
07/03/2021, 01:02 - Num: Like to observe them for the way they react to a certain thing
07/03/2021, 01:03 - Num: Just the functional way of humans reactions.
07/03/2021, 01:03 - Num: And how this would help them live 🤷🏻‍♀️
07/03/2021, 01:03 - Num: Ik stupid but that's psychology for you 😶

07/03/2021, 01:09 - Num: Okay i am not sure if this will make sense but hopefully it would.
For functionalism it focus on the purpose of the behavior not the behavior itself
07/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: so can we link it to white box and black box
07/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: black box : functionalism
white box: structurealism
07/03/2021, 01:12 - AlyaFeai: Testing if u remember

07/03/2021, 01:14 - AlyaFeai: I really don't know
07/03/2021, 01:15 - Num: Okay let's say the military
07/03/2021, 01:16 - Num: For the structuralism.
It's about the ranks or the soldiers and the way the orders should be followed. The inside
07/03/2021, 01:16 - Num: But for the functionalism.
It's the purpose. Like why do we need it and how should it be performed
07/03/2021, 01:17 - Num: This could be a horrible explanation you can tell me honestly
07/03/2021, 01:17 - AlyaFeai: but we look at it as a whole
07/03/2021, 01:22 - Num: True
07/03/2021, 01:22 - Num: That's why I should never be a teacher..

09/03/2021, 16:30 - AlyaFeai: So let's just do question
09/03/2021, 16:30 - AlyaFeai: And then I'll leave u alone
09/03/2021, 16:30 - AlyaFeai: Ok?
09/03/2021, 16:30 - Num: Walla i don't think this is fair
09/03/2021, 16:31 - AlyaFeai: walla I think it's fair
09/03/2021, 16:31 - AlyaFeai: so listen question one require 3 things
09/03/2021, 16:31 - Num: The a b and the root
09/03/2021, 16:31 - Num: Right?
09/03/2021, 16:32 - AlyaFeai: the final solution in bisection
calculate howmany iteration do we need to find an answer with the specific tolerance he gave
draw the function in the intercal he gave us
09/03/2021, 16:32 - AlyaFeai: so which one do u find it easy for u to do
09/03/2021, 16:32 - AlyaFeai: and which one u find it hard?
09/03/2021, 16:32 - Num: Okay wait! Do we have to draw from the beginning?
09/03/2021, 16:32 - AlyaFeai: the interval he gave us
09/03/2021, 16:33 - AlyaFeai: drawing is easy leave it for me
09/03/2021, 16:33 - AlyaFeai: now which one do u want to do and I will do the oteher
09/03/2021, 16:33 - Num: That's cheating! So I don't think so!
09/03/2021, 16:33 - AlyaFeai: I will explain for u the code
09/03/2021, 16:33 - AlyaFeai: so it won't consider as cheating
09/03/2021, 16:34 - Num: 👀
09/03/2021, 16:34 - AlyaFeai: so which one u find it easy
09/03/2021, 16:35 - AlyaFeai: Hello
09/03/2021, 16:35 - Num: Hi
09/03/2021, 16:35 - AlyaFeai: which one u find it easy
09/03/2021, 16:36 - Num: The whole thing comes together I still don't know how you divided it
09/03/2021, 16:36 - AlyaFeai: ok then
09/03/2021, 16:36 - AlyaFeai: give me one sec
09/03/2021, 16:37 - AlyaFeai: iterations=int((ln⁡(20-0)-ln⁡(1x10-8))/ln⁡(2) )=31
09/03/2021, 16:37 - AlyaFeai: this is for amount of iteration
09/03/2021, 16:39 - Num: Why is it 1×10-8?
09/03/2021, 16:39 - Num: Oh wait ncm6
09/03/2021, 16:39 - Num: Nvm*
09/03/2021, 16:39 - Num: I get it
09/03/2021, 16:40 - AlyaFeai: ```
from math import log
def bisection(a,b,c):

    x=c
    fc=round(eval(equation),9)
    if fc==0:
        print("solved c= {c}")
        return [0,0]
    if (fc<0 and fb>0) or (fc>0 and fb<0):
        return [c,b]

a=0
b=20

        break
print(f"a= {a},\t b= {b},\t c= {c}")

```
09/03/2021, 16:41 - AlyaFeai: this is the code for solving it I just sdelete it a couple of things
09/03/2021, 16:41 - AlyaFeai: I don;'t think u need to post this code
09/03/2021, 16:41 - AlyaFeai: and this is the final answer after 31 iteration
09/03/2021, 16:41 - AlyaFeai: a= 11.861501503,	 b= 11.861501512,	 c= 11.861501512

09/03/2021, 18:25 - Num: No i was trying to find away to phrase it
09/03/2021, 18:26 - AlyaFeai: nop I don't think so
maybe if I don't understand them then sometime I will feel bad about them when they don't even deserve it
09/03/2021, 18:26 - Num: بالعكس تماما
09/03/2021, 18:27 - Num: I feel bad for her because I know what is she trying to do
09/03/2021, 18:27 - Num: So this would make me look like I am only taking her side
09/03/2021, 18:27 - Num: When in reality I just feel bad for her

09/03/2021, 18:28 - AlyaFeai: she made herself lose everything
09/03/2021, 18:28 - AlyaFeai: so she deserve everything
09/03/2021, 18:28 - Num: That'd either make you heartless or a lier
09/03/2021, 18:28 - Num: لإنو مافي حل وسط
09/03/2021, 18:28 - AlyaFeai: acting smart to pull me and make fight for her making her to lose more
09/03/2021, 18:28 - AlyaFeai: no I am not heartless
09/03/2021, 18:28 - AlyaFeai: but I just use logic

09/03/2021, 18:29 - Num: 😂😂 That's where we differ 😶
09/03/2021, 18:29 - AlyaFeai: because I already know myself I didn't do anything
09/03/2021, 18:29 - AlyaFeai: wrong
09/03/2021, 18:29 - Num: I am not saying she is right! I am saying the motive is just different from what appears
09/03/2021, 18:29 - AlyaFeai: or I could make her depressed for years after what she told me last time
09/03/2021, 18:30 - AlyaFeai: if I open up as what she did and said everything about me
09/03/2021, 18:30 - Num: That's why she is still there
09/03/2021, 18:30 - AlyaFeai: still that would never let me feel bad
09/03/2021, 18:30 - Num: يا رب. ولد!!
09/03/2021, 18:30 - AlyaFeai: see what she did just have 2 ways

09/03/2021, 18:31 - AlyaFeai: which I don't think this because she wouldn't come back now
09/03/2021, 18:31 - AlyaFeai: or
09/03/2021, 18:31 - AlyaFeai: she thought that we came back normally and she will start her stupid shit that she didn't  do it for long time and make problems with me and assuming that I will come to fix the problem
09/03/2021, 18:31 - Num: Or?
09/03/2021, 18:32 - AlyaFeai: and I think it's the 2nd one
09/03/2021, 18:32 - AlyaFeai: because if it's the first one then yea she wouldn't come fix the problem

11/03/2021, 17:24 - AlyaFeai: but our doctor
11/03/2021, 17:24 - AlyaFeai: told us solve it in preemptive way
11/03/2021, 17:24 - AlyaFeai: but u solved it in non preemptive
11/03/2021, 17:24 - AlyaFeai: so Idk did ur dr tell u to solve it
11/03/2021, 17:24 - AlyaFeai: in non-preemptive

11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: but
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: now let me tell you what u did wrong in AWY
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: AWT*
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: Average Waiting Time
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: so it's about how much the process waited outside the process
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: so for example
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: if we take
11/03/2021, 17:26 - AlyaFeai: Round robin
11/03/2021, 17:27 - AlyaFeai: .
11/03/2021, 17:27 - AlyaFeai: for example for A
11/03/2021, 17:27 - Num: Okay
11/03/2021, 17:28 - Num: 110-30?
11/03/2021, 17:28 - AlyaFeai: 0--(in CPU)--30--(Waiting)--110--(in CPU)--130--(Done)
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: you just calculate
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: the intervals where the process was waiting
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: it been waiting from
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: 110-30
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: for A
11/03/2021, 17:29 - AlyaFeai: for B
11/03/2021, 17:30 - AlyaFeai: 20--(waiting)--30--(in CPU)--50--(Done)
11/03/2021, 17:31 - AlyaFeai: so it only waited from
11/03/2021, 17:31 - AlyaFeai: 30-20
11/03/2021, 17:31 - AlyaFeai: which 10
11/03/2021, 17:31 - AlyaFeai: for C
11/03/2021, 17:31 - Num: Hmmm okay
11/03/2021, 17:31 - AlyaFeai: doe it make sense to u?
11/03/2021, 17:31 - Num: Yes it does
11/03/2021, 17:31 - Num: But I don't remember our doctor saying anything like that
11/03/2021, 17:32 - Num: Which only makes it more believable... She does that sometimes
11/03/2021, 17:32 - AlyaFeai: 40--(waiting)--80--(in CPU)--110--(waiting)--140--(in CPU)--170--(Done)
11/03/2021, 17:32 - AlyaFeai: she didn't
11/03/2021, 17:32 - AlyaFeai: explain that for u?
11/03/2021, 17:32 - Num: I don't remember
11/03/2021, 17:33 - Num: It's doesn't matter
11/03/2021, 17:33 - Num: Idc anymore

11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: inshallah
11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: all did the same mistake as u
11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: so she remember
11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: she didn't explain that
11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: or inshallah
11/03/2021, 17:33 - Num: So this from
40 to 80
And from 110 to 140
11/03/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: that she think this is right way

13/03/2021, 03:11 - Num: Some of then even go further than just tricking! Like threatening and manipulating!
13/03/2021, 03:11 - AlyaFeai: then we have either to be bad with girls

13/03/2021, 03:15 - AlyaFeai: and maybe I will put u in tthe top of the list
13/03/2021, 03:16 - AlyaFeai: u relate some stuff to other in the weirdest way and I know you are not stupid which mean u have something meaningful behind it which mean u have this weird complex brain of the girls
13/03/2021, 03:16 - Num: Them as in guys or girls?
13/03/2021, 03:16 - AlyaFeai: girls
13/03/2021, 03:17 - Num: Okay chill

13/03/2021, 15:24 - AlyaFeai: Because what kind of person would u use someone he like
13/03/2021, 15:24 - Num: Okay but think of it!

13/03/2021, 15:26 - Num: Okay no
13/03/2021, 15:26 - Num: This is heartless
13/03/2021, 15:26 - AlyaFeai: Yea she use to do that because she had me
13/03/2021, 15:26 - AlyaFeai: I am happy to make someone comfortable and relax
13/03/2021, 15:27 - AlyaFeai: But that's doesn't mean
13/03/2021, 15:27 - AlyaFeai: He fully show it
13/03/2021, 15:27 - Num: Okay this is too much relaying
13/03/2021, 15:27 - Num: Almost obsessed
13/03/2021, 15:27 - Num: And I didn't say this is okay
13/03/2021, 15:28 - Num: But think of it from a desperate kind of way
13/03/2021, 15:28 - Num: If you want to spend time with a person how would you do it
13/03/2021, 15:28 - Num: Games she played and studying was another option
13/03/2021, 15:28 - Num: But other than that she had 0 ways
13/03/2021, 15:29 - Num: For example like programming... Or just self improvement
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: Ok I'm not saying she shouldn't
13/03/2021, 15:29 - Num: Idk some stuff differ
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: But
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: Not leaving everything to me
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: At the first time I was like
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: I keep talk and explain
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: So maybe she would do something
13/03/2021, 15:29 - AlyaFeai: If I give her a chance
13/03/2021, 15:30 - AlyaFeai: After million of explaining
13/03/2021, 15:30 - AlyaFeai: I asked her for one chapter
13/03/2021, 15:30 - AlyaFeai: And I said I'll explain the rest to her
13/03/2021, 15:30 - AlyaFeai: And I just remember not only that
13/03/2021, 15:30 - AlyaFeai: I said I'll explain research methodology for her as well
13/03/2021, 15:30 - Num: This is agree with
13/03/2021, 15:31 - Num: This where I don't agree though 👀
13/03/2021, 15:31 - AlyaFeai: I shouldn't do that
13/03/2021, 15:31 - AlyaFeai: But I hated that chapter so
13/03/2021, 15:31 - AlyaFeai: I just wanted her to explain it to me and ill
13/03/2021, 15:31 - AlyaFeai: Work on  the other
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: But again a trash person I was relaying on
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: Actually
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: She started explain to me the begin of the chapter
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: And she was just explaining wrong thjng
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: Or just keep skiing
13/03/2021, 15:32 - AlyaFeai: So I noticed she didn't even give effort for it
13/03/2021, 15:32 - Num: Hmmmm......okkkaayyyy
13/03/2021, 15:32 - Num: Okay this is bad
13/03/2021, 15:32 - Num: Okay see
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: And another time
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: I know I maybe asked for a lot
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: But for the amount I helped her I don't think that would big
13/03/2021, 15:33 - Num: You never do!
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: I asked
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: Her to do for me
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: A research
13/03/2021, 15:33 - AlyaFeai: Same thing she didn't
13/03/2021, 15:33 - Num: I know you for a little time compared to her but I know you give twice the amount
13/03/2021, 15:34 - Num: 😶💔 Okay
13/03/2021, 15:34 - AlyaFeai: It's not right
13/03/2021, 15:34 - AlyaFeai: But I just wanted to see if she have the chance to pay back would she
13/03/2021, 15:34 - AlyaFeai: But no
13/03/2021, 15:34 - AlyaFeai: She doesn't
13/03/2021, 15:34 - AlyaFeai: She would only pay back if she is losing nothing
13/03/2021, 15:35 - Num: Okay look. I am not sure if I told you before! But I still think she is toxic! And I don't think she'll be a good enough person on her own
13/03/2021, 15:35 - Num: But that doesn't mean I couldn't sympathize with her
13/03/2021, 15:35 - Num: You can say i feel bad for her! But I don't agree
13/03/2021, 15:35 - AlyaFeai: No still u shouldn't
13/03/2021, 15:35 - AlyaFeai: Someone who think in this way
13/03/2021, 15:36 - AlyaFeai: Is just so low
13/03/2021, 15:36 - Num: You cannot just not! It's not that easy
13/03/2021, 15:36 - AlyaFeai: And don't deserve any sympathy
13/03/2021, 15:36 - Num: Yes but some people are so HELPLESS that you have to feel bad for
13/03/2021, 15:36 - AlyaFeai: No she is just using that
13/03/2021, 15:36 - Num: 🤷🏻‍♀️ Call it pity the.
13/03/2021, 15:36 - Num: Then*
13/03/2021, 15:36 - AlyaFeai: And imagine

13/03/2021, 15:36 - AlyaFeai: Of making problems
13/03/2021, 15:37 - AlyaFeai: I hinted for her once
13/03/2021, 15:37 - AlyaFeai: That she is using people
13/03/2021, 15:37 - AlyaFeai: Because she also had a friend

22/03/2021, 01:07 - Num: I don't ignore people for that reason

22/03/2021, 01:07 - AlyaFeai: Which is
22/03/2021, 01:07 - Num: I cut people off easily
22/03/2021, 01:07 - AlyaFeai: What do u mean

22/03/2021, 01:08 - AlyaFeai: But does this work in everyone
22/03/2021, 01:09 - Num: Yes litterly everyone

22/03/2021, 01:09 - AlyaFeai: Like other people when they lose someone
22/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: Buttt
22/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: Bad
22/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: because u can't do this to everyone u need to see the person
22/03/2021, 01:10 - AlyaFeai: who u will cut him off
22/03/2021, 01:11 - Num: Well the line that can be crossed depends on the person
22/03/2021, 01:11 - Num: But other than that idk.. It doesn't effect me that much
22/03/2021, 01:11 - AlyaFeai: but is this enough to change the line

23/03/2021, 01:08 - Num: Okay this is what happens
23/03/2021, 01:08 - Num: Hiding stuff is the same as acting the opposite of it

23/03/2021, 01:14 - AlyaFeai: it wrong
23/03/2021, 01:14 - AlyaFeai: being comfortable around someone

23/03/2021, 01:14 - AlyaFeai: but
23/03/2021, 01:14 - Num: We can't say it's wrong it is an opinion after all
23/03/2021, 01:15 - AlyaFeai: I will not start something that I don't have it from the begin and then when I become comfortable
23/03/2021, 01:15 - AlyaFeai: I start change it
23/03/2021, 01:15 - Num: Yeah that's how it works

23/03/2021, 01:17 - Num: Anyways
23/03/2021, 01:17 - Num: I disagree a little
23/03/2021, 01:18 - AlyaFeai: no just imagine it I show u stuff u like just u get close to me and then I change them
23/03/2021, 01:18 - Num: Okay but what if it's the only thing that makes people avoid you!
23/03/2021, 01:18 - Num: Maybe you like just a completely different thing from others
23/03/2021, 01:19 - AlyaFeai: what do u mean?
23/03/2021, 01:19 - Num: So you misunderstood it and thought I was actually trying to show you something you like
23/03/2021, 01:20 - Num: Imagine if for example you don't curse alot in front of people. And that just make others think you are a nerd/loser/old school or whatever
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: I don't really care
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: as far I think
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: what I am doing
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: is right
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: Idc
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: if it was the opposite way
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: which is actually
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: I have one
23/03/2021, 01:20 - AlyaFeai: and I am trying my best to stop it
23/03/2021, 01:20 - Num: But there's this one person who likes the fact that you don't curse so he tries to befriend you
23/03/2021, 01:21 - AlyaFeai: yea carry on
23/03/2021, 01:21 - Num: Yeah i know but doesn't this just go against your point?
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: no
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: trying to change something
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: that u really
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: want to change it forever
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: different
23/03/2021, 01:22 - Num: If you get comfortable and start cursing in front of that person you'll be seen as a person who changed?
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: than
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: change it for a temper time and then get it back
23/03/2021, 01:22 - Num: Why would you change it instead of accepting it?
23/03/2021, 01:22 - AlyaFeai: because I know that what I am doing is wrong
23/03/2021, 01:23 - Num: It's just hidden not changing.. Just to protect yourself
23/03/2021, 01:23 - AlyaFeai: hide it
23/03/2021, 01:23 - AlyaFeai: it's ok
23/03/2021, 01:23 - AlyaFeai: but
23/03/2021, 01:23 - AlyaFeai: show something else
23/03/2021, 01:23 - AlyaFeai: that's not ok
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: for example
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: the part of insulting
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: if I will hide it then I will just try to not insult infront of him at the begin
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: but
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: I will not
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: start act
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: as I get disgust by someone
23/03/2021, 01:24 - AlyaFeai: when I see him insulting
23/03/2021, 01:25 - AlyaFeai: just because Ik he love this
23/03/2021, 01:25 - Num: ممكن يكون جس نبض
23/03/2021, 01:25 - AlyaFeai: ما فهمت شو هو جس نبص
23/03/2021, 01:25 - AlyaFeai: ض
23/03/2021, 01:26 - Num: To know if it's okay if I open up to him normally what kind of reaction I'll get
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: u mean like for one time
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: to see what would he say
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: to know how he think about that
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: yea that's ok
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: I am not talking about one situation
23/03/2021, 01:26 - AlyaFeai: I am talking about taking a whole period
23/03/2021, 01:27 - AlyaFeai: keep showing this good
23/03/2021, 01:27 - AlyaFeai: attitude until both of u get comfortable with each other
23/03/2021, 01:27 - AlyaFeai: getting comfortable with each other means open up
23/03/2021, 01:27 - AlyaFeai: not show reality
23/03/2021, 01:27 - Num: Idk
23/03/2021, 01:28 - AlyaFeai: of the fake stuff
23/03/2021, 01:28 - Num: I know you'll not agree with me but I can exuse these people
23/03/2021, 01:28 - AlyaFeai: it's excuseable at the end because many do it
23/03/2021, 01:28 - Num: On the contrary! This is exactly what it means
23/03/2021, 01:28 - AlyaFeai: but there is a limit of accepting some stuff
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: also if we specifiy that girl
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: she is in another situation
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: so the thing we were talking about
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: it was two period
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: the period where the 2 are still knowing each other and then the other period it's after both get comfortable
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: she has extra one
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: which is
23/03/2021, 01:29 - AlyaFeai: from the time the problems start
23/03/2021, 01:30 - AlyaFeai: and she start feel
23/03/2021, 01:30 - AlyaFeai: that she is losing a friend

23/03/2021, 01:39 - AlyaFeai: when she talk

03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: But she is
03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: Acting dumb

03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: Like ok its fine to ask me
03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: But not everything
03/04/2021, 20:00 - Num: Tell her to watch the recording! You don't have time to explain the whole thing from the beginning!
03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: I am already doing that
03/04/2021, 20:00 - AlyaFeai: And like there is an assignment
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: And project part 3
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: Every step she do
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: She come to me
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: Is this right

03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: Is this right for question 3 for assignment 2
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: Is this right is this right
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: I was surprised that she is not new student but I don't know her
03/04/2021, 20:01 - AlyaFeai: I did my research
03/04/2021, 20:02 - AlyaFeai: And she probably having financial problems
03/04/2021, 20:02 - AlyaFeai: Because she is taking some semesters 3 course and then she stop for semester or 2
03/04/2021, 20:02 - AlyaFeai: Then she come  back again
03/04/2021, 20:02 - AlyaFeai: And that's the only reason I feel she deserve help
03/04/2021, 20:03 - AlyaFeai: Because she probably struggling
03/04/2021, 20:03 - AlyaFeai: But then
03/04/2021, 20:03 - AlyaFeai: Before like 2 days
03/04/2021, 20:03 - AlyaFeai: Someone send in web group

03/04/2021, 20:03 - AlyaFeai: She came to talk to me
03/04/2021, 20:04 - AlyaFeai: And then I find out she is the same one who is talking to me in teams
03/04/2021, 20:04 - AlyaFeai: And as a person who is struggling financially I don't think you would search for a doctor to pay him
03/04/2021, 20:04 - AlyaFeai: To teach u more
03/04/2021, 20:04 - Num: Teach you more?

03/04/2021, 20:09 - Num: I didn't want to sound rude
03/04/2021, 20:09 - AlyaFeai: I took a bad idea about her
03/04/2021, 20:10 - AlyaFeai: And this girl I use to talk to her filled my brain with more bad thing about her but I end up regretting that
03/04/2021, 20:10 - AlyaFeai: I thought she is just talking to me for help
03/04/2021, 20:10 - AlyaFeai: Especially I was so helpful in first semester
03/04/2021, 20:10 - AlyaFeai: Because I only had 5 courses
03/04/2021, 20:11 - AlyaFeai: And I wasn't worried about people copying my work exactly
03/04/2021, 20:11 - AlyaFeai: But then after a couple of semester when she saw me so busy I find out that she is looking for help
03/04/2021, 20:11 - AlyaFeai: I tried to ask her hi how are u

13/04/2021, 00:18 - Num: Idk if this makes sense but yeah
13/04/2021, 00:19 - AlyaFeai: That's right if the passport will give u an upper hand 
But it's not it's only return u to the fair level and having equal chance with other

13/04/2021, 00:20 - Num: That I could do it when I had equal chance with other so like I had no help or back up
13/04/2021, 00:21 - AlyaFeai: U don't have equa chance

13/04/2021, 00:23 - Num: Idk i can be weird
13/04/2021, 00:23 - AlyaFeai: Alright I just wanted to show u getting the passport is not giving u advantage it's just putting u in the start line instead of start way back of start line with ur current passport

19/04/2021, 12:38 - Num: You started?
19/04/2021, 12:40 - AlyaFeai: good morning
19/04/2021, 12:40 - AlyaFeai: quizzes
19/04/2021, 12:40 - AlyaFeai: no
19/04/2021, 12:43 - Num: Okay we just finished it now
19/04/2021, 12:43 - Num: <Media omitted>
19/04/2021, 12:43 - Num: <Media omitted>
19/04/2021, 12:44 - Num: Not the clearest 😶💔 but this is it
19/04/2021, 12:46 - AlyaFeai: only
19/04/2021, 12:46 - AlyaFeai: this question?
19/04/2021, 12:46 - Num: Yes
19/04/2021, 12:46 - AlyaFeai: really!
19/04/2021, 12:46 - Num: It was easy alhamdulillah
19/04/2021, 12:46 - AlyaFeai: did ur class did bad in the mid?
19/04/2021, 12:46 - Num: 😂😂
19/04/2021, 12:46 - Num: Idk maybe 🤷🏻‍♀️
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Num: https://gateoverflow.in/192803/memory-allocation-doubt
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Num: Someone found the question online
19/04/2021, 12:47 - Num: It's the same😶
19/04/2021, 12:48 - AlyaFeai: the thing is
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: our doctor
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: said
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: only those
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: but then
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: he saw our marks in mid
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: he was like no
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: then everyone will have good marks
19/04/2021, 12:49 - Num: 👀 This is so low of him!!
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: study all chapter 4
19/04/2021, 12:49 - Num: 🙂
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: focus on allocation in memory
19/04/2021, 12:49 - AlyaFeai: but I will include anything
19/04/2021, 12:50 - Num: What the hell is wrong with him🙄
19/04/2021, 12:50 - Num: Our class didn't do bad in the mid!
19/04/2021, 12:50 - Num: At least I don't remember it being that bad
19/04/2021, 12:51 - Num: Specially if we're talking from a doctor's pov
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: Idk
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: what can we do
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: I studied
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: all chapter 4
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: yesterday
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: but explain to me the question
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: what does she mean
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: with
19/04/2021, 12:52 - AlyaFeai: best fit but not first fit
19/04/2021, 12:53 - Num: يعطيك العافية!!
19/04/2021, 12:53 - Num: We need to solve it in both best fit algo  and  first fit algo.
So we choose the algorithm that satisfys all the processes.
19/04/2021, 12:54 - Num: Best fit algorithm does not satisfy it. There'd be a process left un handled. That's why it is first fit not best fiy
19/04/2021, 12:54 - Num: Fit *
19/04/2021, 12:55 - AlyaFeai: am I dumb or what?
19/04/2021, 12:55 - AlyaFeai: I am not understanding
19/04/2021, 12:55 - Num: No you are not!
19/04/2021, 12:55 - AlyaFeai: listen give me one sec I will go pray because in 5 mins the web quiz will start
19/04/2021, 12:55 - Num: K tyt
19/04/2021, 12:56 - Num: I'll explain meanwhile then🌚
19/04/2021, 13:00 - AlyaFeai: are u at work?
19/04/2021, 13:01 - Num: So the processes we need to handle are.
300k,25k,125k,50k
And we have holes or available sizes are 150k,350k
19/04/2021, 13:01 - AlyaFeai: ok this is clear
19/04/2021, 13:02 - Num: So for first fit algo we just solve it where we look for an available space from the beginning to the end of the holes to see if the process would fit
19/04/2021, 13:02 - Num: 300k won't fit in 150k so we move to 350k
Therefore we have
150(),300k,50()
19/04/2021, 13:02 - AlyaFeai: .
19/04/2021, 13:03 - Num: The () are holes okay?
19/04/2021, 13:03 - AlyaFeai: ok
19/04/2021, 13:04 - Num: Then we'll check for the next process
25k can be handled by 150?yes
Therefore we'll have
25k,125(),300k,50()
19/04/2021, 13:05 - AlyaFeai: yes
19/04/2021, 13:05 - Num: Then 125k can be satisfied in 125()
So
25k,125k,300k, 50()
19/04/2021, 13:05 - AlyaFeai: that's how you solve but I mean the sections A) B) C) D)
19/04/2021, 13:05 - Num: Ohh
19/04/2021, 13:05 - AlyaFeai: what does she mean with First but not best
19/04/2021, 13:05 - AlyaFeai: or best but not first
19/04/2021, 13:05 - Num: No that's only the opinions you chose from
19/04/2021, 13:06 - AlyaFeai: OHHHHHHHHH
19/04/2021, 13:06 - AlyaFeai: ok I'm sorry for wasting ur time with my stupid question
19/04/2021, 13:06 - Num: After solving you'll end up with only firt for to satisfy the process
As best fit doesn't
19/04/2021, 13:06 - AlyaFeai: do u want to join me with my web quiz?
19/04/2021, 13:06 - Num: No problem! Sorry I misunderstood

19/04/2021, 21:40 - AlyaFeai: alarm
19/04/2021, 21:40 - AlyaFeai: later
19/04/2021, 21:40 - Num: 👀 Later as in after he submition time ends
19/04/2021, 21:40 - Num: No! Now

20/04/2021, 20:12 - AlyaFeai: To complete this 
Girls born without logic that's why Cs is good for them
20/04/2021, 20:30 - Num: 🙂 Are you really ready to go through this🙃
20/04/2021, 20:30 - Num: Because I don't understand why would doctors marry doctors and engineers marry engineers! Like you don't get bored? Nothing new to find out about your significant other! Idk this is just me

20/04/2021, 20:37 - Num: No hold on
20/04/2021, 20:38 - Num: That topic is a complete out of topic kind is discussion! And let's not forget that your OPINION does not reflect one but on your logical thinking

Forgot it
20/04/2021, 20:39 - Num: But regardless. What about my other sister. Who isn't a CS student but completely supports her 'husband' to agree with her if he feels like even if he's talking about another human
20/04/2021, 20:40 - AlyaFeai: It seems like u still have some of the ladies logic inside u
20/04/2021, 20:40 - AlyaFeai: Cs didn't change u enough

27/05/2021, 17:32 - AlyaFeai: Now
27/05/2021, 17:32 - AlyaFeai: He is free
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: And he is coming up with things without I ask him
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: The gpa
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: Thinga
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: I told him its not important
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: And he worked
27/05/2021, 17:33 - AlyaFeai: For it
27/05/2021, 17:34 - Num: Oh congrats to him
27/05/2021, 17:34 - Num: 😶 I mean that's just your team work my child! You do the same
27/05/2021, 17:35 - AlyaFeai: Yea but I'm showing u he is not lazy he just had problems
27/05/2021, 17:36 - Num: Okay
27/05/2021, 17:36 - Num: I still don't like him
27/05/2021, 17:36 - Num: Not everyone is lazy
27/05/2021, 17:36 - AlyaFeai: Alright
27/05/2021, 17:36 - AlyaFeai: Inshallah

27/05/2021, 17:36 - AlyaFeai: Right?
27/05/2021, 17:37 - Num: Don't think so
27/05/2021, 17:37 - Num: Yes
27/05/2021, 17:37 - AlyaFeai: And u will go to sleep
27/05/2021, 17:37 - AlyaFeai: Or u have something else

27/05/2021, 17:37 - AlyaFeai: Or do u have nothing
27/05/2021, 18:06 - Num: I really want to 🥺
27/05/2021, 18:06 - Num: Yeah I'm going out
27/05/2021, 18:06 - AlyaFeai: Oh ok
27/05/2021, 18:06 - Num: But after that I have nothing
27/05/2021, 18:06 - AlyaFeai: Good
27/05/2021, 18:06 - AlyaFeai: Enjoy
27/05/2021, 18:06 - Num: Thanks my child
27/05/2021, 18:06 - Num: But why? Is everything okay?
27/05/2021, 18:07 - AlyaFeai: No just
27/05/2021, 18:07 - AlyaFeai: General
27/05/2021, 18:07 - AlyaFeai: Questions

28/05/2021, 23:45 - Num: Nothing much to be honest
28/05/2021, 23:46 - Num: Mainly sleep
28/05/2021, 23:46 - Num: I got out but that was it
28/05/2021, 23:46 - AlyaFeai: I wanted to say that but i felt its disrespect for u 😂
28/05/2021, 23:46 - AlyaFeai: Oh ok that's good then
28/05/2021, 23:46 - Num: What about you how was yours
28/05/2021, 23:46 - Num: 😂😂😂!!! Heyyy
28/05/2021, 23:46 - AlyaFeai: Dead
28/05/2021, 23:46 - Num: Why what happened?
28/05/2021, 23:46 - AlyaFeai: I just went to wait in long line and then when almost my turn they close
28/05/2021, 23:47 - AlyaFeai: +
28/05/2021, 23:47 - AlyaFeai: I'm trying to work In capstone but I'm stuck
28/05/2021, 23:47 - AlyaFeai: I can't figure what do I want to program
28/05/2021, 23:47 - Num: 😶 Oh wow!! Talk about luck
28/05/2021, 23:47 - Num: What or how?
28/05/2021, 23:47 - AlyaFeai: Like
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: I have to program A* star
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: Search
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: And my brain just keep freezing
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: Because I just directly start code
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: Then I went to paint 3d
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: Trying to design what I want to do
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: I draw stuff that doesn't make sense
28/05/2021, 23:48 - AlyaFeai: Got pissed delete the whole painting
28/05/2021, 23:49 - AlyaFeai: And now I just give up
28/05/2021, 23:49 - AlyaFeai: And closed everything
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: 😂😂💔
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: Okay
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: How about you sit with yourself for a moment
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: Try to agree on what to add
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: Like a different thing
28/05/2021, 23:49 - Num: Then come back this one later
28/05/2021, 23:49 - AlyaFeai: No see I just hated
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: How we been working in small things
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: And the  suddenly
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: He was like
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: U do A* search
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: As its something simple
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: That's the whole software
28/05/2021, 23:50 - AlyaFeai: Or almost
28/05/2021, 23:50 - Num: Yeah but he probably trust you to do it better
28/05/2021, 23:51 - Num: Can you like do a different part of it?
28/05/2021, 23:51 - AlyaFeai: What do u mean?
28/05/2021, 23:51 - AlyaFeai: He didn't ask part of it
28/05/2021, 23:51 - AlyaFeai: He asked for whole thing
28/05/2021, 23:51 - Num: 😶 The whole thing is on you!?
28/05/2021, 23:52 - Num: That's comp not fair!
28/05/2021, 23:52 - AlyaFeai: He said he will fix everything
28/05/2021, 23:52 - AlyaFeai: That they asked us in capstone 1 to fix
28/05/2021, 23:52 - Num: But regardless take a moment away from the program and come back to it in like an hour or 2
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: I really don't know how
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: To
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: Understand what I want
28/05/2021, 23:53 - Num: 😶 Oh yeah? And why are they still not fixed till now?
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: I searched un implementation from someone else
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: So I can start understand what to do
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: I have never implemented any type of search
28/05/2021, 23:53 - AlyaFeai: That's the problem
28/05/2021, 23:54 - Num: I am not sure if its the same but do you remember the trees we took in data structures?
28/05/2021, 23:54 - AlyaFeai: Yea
28/05/2021, 23:55 - Num: There're many types of searches
28/05/2021, 23:55 - Num: For them
28/05/2021, 23:55 - AlyaFeai: Oh wait
28/05/2021, 23:55 - AlyaFeai: I shouldn't call it
28/05/2021, 23:55 - AlyaFeai: Search
28/05/2021, 23:55 - AlyaFeai: I mean shortest path
28/05/2021, 23:55 - Num: Oh okay
28/05/2021, 23:55 - Num: Wait hold up a sec
28/05/2021, 23:55 - AlyaFeai: Ok
28/05/2021, 23:56 - Num: Isn't called a graph?
28/05/2021, 23:56 - Num: This way of finding I mean
28/05/2021, 23:57 - AlyaFeai: Yea u search it in graph
28/05/2021, 23:57 - Num: Like you name some spots and then the points get measured by a loop
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: I don't know what do u mean
But I have a start and end point and I search for the shortest path
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: Or let me say the optimal path
28/05/2021, 23:58 - Num: Okay but let's say we have like 3 paths to get there
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: I'll use
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: The height of each node
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: And the surface type
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: To give values
28/05/2021, 23:58 - AlyaFeai: For each one
28/05/2021, 23:58 - Num: So we measur the least amount of points and the shortest maybe
28/05/2021, 23:59 - Num: Yes
28/05/2021, 23:59 - AlyaFeai: Shortest is the last concern
28/05/2021, 23:59 - AlyaFeai: Since its not hard to get it
28/05/2021, 23:59 - Num: Okay
28/05/2021, 23:59 - Num: Then the amount of nodes used to get to that path
28/05/2021, 23:59 - Num: Should be less
29/05/2021, 00:00 - AlyaFeai: The weight of nodes
29/05/2021, 00:00 - AlyaFeai: Sum of weight
29/05/2021, 00:00 - Num: Weight?
29/05/2021, 00:00 - AlyaFeai: For the path should be lowest
29/05/2021, 00:00 - Num: Wdym by the weight of them?
29/05/2021, 00:00 - AlyaFeai: The weight will be calculated by using the height and surface type
29/05/2021, 00:01 - Num: But why would you need that?
29/05/2021, 00:01 - AlyaFeai: To see which node is better for a car
29/05/2021, 00:01 - AlyaFeai: To drive on
29/05/2021, 00:01 - AlyaFeai: If its
29/05/2021, 00:01 - AlyaFeai: A bad surface
29/05/2021, 00:01 - Num: Oh okay
29/05/2021, 00:02 - AlyaFeai: And its very height compared to the current node he is on
29/05/2021, 00:02 - AlyaFeai: Then that will have a high value
29/05/2021, 00:02 - Num: So even if there're hills they'll know
29/05/2021, 00:02 - AlyaFeai: Yea
29/05/2021, 00:03 - Num: Okay why is that a problem? Can't it be compared by the colour?
29/05/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: The
29/05/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: Colour was just
29/05/2021, 00:03 - AlyaFeai: For visualising
29/05/2021, 00:03 - Num: But it is used for the code no?
29/05/2021, 00:04 - AlyaFeai: I have it as a raw data
29/05/2021, 00:04 - AlyaFeai: The same data I used to draw the map
29/05/2021, 00:04 - AlyaFeai: Ill use it for search
29/05/2021, 00:04 - Num: Okay so it can be directly used
29/05/2021, 00:05 - AlyaFeai: Yea
29/05/2021, 00:05 - Num: I am not sure if I get you right but can't you like a sign a certain value to the colour code so whenever it crossed by you'll be able to know the hight
29/05/2021, 00:05 - Num: Or the risk to use this path
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: Wait
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: Getting the height
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: Is not anproblw
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: I already have height of each block
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: In array
29/05/2021, 00:06 - Num: Then what is the problem 👀
29/05/2021, 00:06 - Num: I am lost
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: Idk how to combine
29/05/2021, 00:06 - AlyaFeai: Everything
29/05/2021, 00:07 - AlyaFeai: And do the search
29/05/2021, 00:07 - Num: Can't you define a function to calculate the weight and another to check the nodes?
29/05/2021, 00:08 - AlyaFeai: I don't have a graph still 😂
29/05/2021, 00:08 - AlyaFeai: I have everything aa a list
29/05/2021, 00:08 - AlyaFeai: I wanted to convert it to graph
29/05/2021, 00:08 - AlyaFeai: Then for some reason  I find it useless
29/05/2021, 00:08 - Num: Okay so step one do the graph
29/05/2021, 00:08 - Num: Why is it?
29/05/2021, 00:09 - AlyaFeai: I thought of doing the search
29/05/2021, 00:09 - AlyaFeai: By just assuming
29/05/2021, 00:09 - AlyaFeai: The 2d list as a graph
29/05/2021, 00:09 - Num: I think i am lost again
29/05/2021, 00:10 - Num: Why would you assume that the 2d list is a graph?
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: Because
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: First I'll waste
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: Time
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: On creating the graph
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: Not me
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: I'm talking about programming
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: 2ndly
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: I need to rest the whole graph
29/05/2021, 00:10 - AlyaFeai: After each search
29/05/2021, 00:11 - AlyaFeai: Or initialize it from the begin
29/05/2021, 00:11 - AlyaFeai: Thirdly
29/05/2021, 00:11 - Num: Why? Aren't you using the same graph?
29/05/2021, 00:11 - AlyaFeai: I can't access any point directly from a graph
29/05/2021, 00:11 - AlyaFeai: I don't have one
29/05/2021, 00:11 - AlyaFeai: With graph 
I mean nodes and edges
29/05/2021, 00:12 - Num: Yeah i get it but don't you like have a visual representation for the area?
29/05/2021, 00:12 - AlyaFeai: I have it already
29/05/2021, 00:12 - AlyaFeai: As an array
29/05/2021, 00:13 - AlyaFeai: Converting to graph wouldn't
29/05/2021, 00:13 - AlyaFeai: Change
29/05/2021, 00:13 - AlyaFeai: Or create something new
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: MYbe
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: I'm explaining
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: Sowmethjf
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: In wrong way
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: So forgot it
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: Inshallah
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: Tomorrow
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: My brain will
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: Refresh
29/05/2021, 00:14 - AlyaFeai: And do something
29/05/2021, 00:14 - Num: No no you aren't
29/05/2021, 00:15 - Num: InshaAlla
29/05/2021, 00:15 - Num: You are annoyed?
29/05/2021, 00:15 - AlyaFeai: A little
29/05/2021, 00:15 - AlyaFeai: First time
29/05/2021, 00:15 - AlyaFeai: Feel stuck on something ik
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: But I'll blame it
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: On not having enough sleep
29/05/2021, 00:16 - Num: 👀 And why didn't you!?
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: I woke up for fajer
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: And that wasted one hour
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: And then kept
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: Waking up
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: From fsjer up to 10 am
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: And this always happeb
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: For me
29/05/2021, 00:16 - AlyaFeai: When I change my sleep time.e
29/05/2021, 00:17 - AlyaFeai: I mean normally it happeb
29/05/2021, 00:17 - AlyaFeai: But it increase when I change my sleep time
29/05/2021, 00:17 - Num: Okay can you sleep now?
29/05/2021, 00:17 - Num: Like at least try to?
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: Ill
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: Soon
29/05/2021, 00:18 - Num: You'll barley get any sleep till fajir
29/05/2021, 00:18 - Num: Soon? When is this soon?
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: Mayb
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: 1
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: Or 1:30
29/05/2021, 00:18 - Num: Min?
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: No
29/05/2021, 00:18 - AlyaFeai: Time
29/05/2021, 00:18 - Num: 🙃
29/05/2021, 00:18 - Num: You have 20 min max
29/05/2021, 00:19 - AlyaFeai: Hi

31/05/2021, 11:27 - Num: Well it's not really your mistake since it refuses to show the real errors first 😶
31/05/2021, 11:27 - AlyaFeai: Yea
